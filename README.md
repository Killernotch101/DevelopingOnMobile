# DevelopingOnMobile
Developing ON mobile, not for mobile. This is my toolset for hacking games. (Mostly coolmath, because I have no life.)
ALL of these are bookmarklets.

# Firebug Lite
Firebug Lite was a tiny bookmarklet for Firebug, which was a [debugging extension](https://getfirebug.com). It can be used on mobile, and it also has a helpful DOM that shows you all the variables. Actually, that's all I use it for.

# Javascript Eval
JavascriptEval was made by me, and completely me. You know it's me because of the horrible quality of code you see. It's like a console, but for Mobile and less helpful. ;)

# View (Source/Scripts/Variables)
This was made by Jesse Ruderman. I've found her bookmarklets very useful. See her site [here](https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/).

# LocalStorage Tools
These bookmarklets were made by me. I'm sure it already exists, but I couldn't find it. The LocalStorage Tools would view the keys, view the content of one key, and edit the content of one key. There's also the "CLEAR LOCALSTORAGE" Bookmarklet, but it's not needed.
